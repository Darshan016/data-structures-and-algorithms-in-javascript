# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

This repository contains JavaScript implementations of various data structures and algorithms. It's a collection of code snippets and examples which I learned and implemented.
## Data Structures

1. **Linked List**: Implementation of a singly and doubly linked list.

2. **Queue**: Queue data structure implemented using a linked list.

3. **Stack**: Stack data structure implemented using a linked list.

4. **HashTable**: A simple implementation of a hash table.

5. **Binary Search Tree**: A basic implementation of a binary search tree with methods for insertion, search, traversal, and more.

6. **Graph**: Implementation of a basic graph data structure with methods for adding vertices, edges, and more.

## Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**: Implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.

2. **Search Algorithms**: Includes algorithms like binary search.

3. **Graph Algorithms**: Algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) for graph traversal.

## Usage

Clone the repository and explore the code. You can use this code to understand how these data structures and algorithms work, and even integrate them into your own projects.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Darshan016/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-javascript.git
